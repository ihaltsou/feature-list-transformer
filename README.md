## Install


## Usage
Now that Feature List Transformer is installed globally, run `Feature List Transformer` to use the CLI.

If you want to take it for a test run, copy/paste this into the command line:

```bash

```

To add another task, just follow the same format: `Feature List Transformer [file] [task]`

Or, use these command line arguments:

* `-f`| `--file` specify the file you want to create or append. If no source file is explicitly passed, then `TODO.md` will be created/appended.
* `-t`| `--task` the task you'd like to add to the specified file

Example: `Feature List Transformer -t "Write more documentation"`
